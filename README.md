# My Homelab
I though I just share my Homelab here.  Right now I'm only running a Raspberry Pi 5 and a Synology DS218+ (NAS) in my Homelab, except my Router and a Switch

## Router
Nothing crazy just a normal Speedport Smart 3

It is being DHCP-Server, DNS-Server, Access Point and Switch on my Network

avg. Upstream-Bandwith: 257.69Mbit/s

Network: 192.168.2.0/24

DHCP-Range: 192.168.2.101 - 192.168.2.230

DHCP-Leasetime: 1 day

DNS-Upstreamserver: 8.8.8.8


## Switch
It's a 24 RJ-45 1G non-PoE unmanaged Switch.

That means there are no VLANs in my Network, but there surely will be in further future.

## Raspberry Pi 5
Architecture: ARM

CPU: Broadcom BCM2712 quad-core Cortex A76 @ 2.4GHz

microSD-Storage: 64GB

RAM: 4GB

OS: Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit


### Services running on my Pi
1. Docker-ce
2. Docker-compose
3. Portainer
4. Pihole
5. heimdall
6. Homeassistant Supervised
7. Open vpn #not final
8. many many Cloudflared-container
9. Speedtesttracker

All of my services are published to the internet via the above mentioned Cloudflared Tunnels. Those are able to expose services without opening any ports nor having to deal with ddos-protection or firewalling because Cloudflare is the firewall in that case.
